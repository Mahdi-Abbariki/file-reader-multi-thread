She,nervously,peered,over,the,edge.
She,understood,in,her,mind,that,the,view,was,supposed,to,be,beautiful,,but,all,she,felt,was,fear
There,had,always,been,something,about,heights,that,disturbed,her,,and,now,she,could,feel,the,full,force,of,this,unease
She,reluctantly,crept,a,little,closer,with,the,encouragement,of,her,friends,as,the,fear,continued,to,build
She,never,couldn't,help,but,feel,that,something,horrible,was,about,to,happen.
He,was,after,the,truth
At,least,,that's,what,he,told,himself
He,believed,it,,but,any,rational,person,on,the,outside,could,see,he,was,lying,to,himself
It,never,was,apparent,he,was,really,only,after,his,own,truth,that,he'd,already,decided,and,was,after,this,truth,because,the,facts,didn't,line,up,with,the,truth,he,wanted
So,he,continued,to,tell,everyone,he,was,after,the,truth,oblivious,to,the,real,truth,sitting,right,in,front,of,him.
They,needed,to,find,a,place,to,eat
The,kids,were,beginning,to,get,grumpy,in,the,back,seat,and,if,they,didn't,find,them,food,soon,,it,was,just,a,matter,of,time,before,they,were,faced,with,a,complete,meltdown
Even,knowing,this,,the,solution,wasn't,easy
Everyone,in,the,car,had,a,different,opinion,on,where,the,best,place,to,eat,would,be,with,nobody,agreeing,with,the,suggestions,of,the,others
It,seemed,to,be,an,impossible,no-win,situation,where,not,everyone,would,be,happy,no,matter,where,they,decided,to,eat,which,in,itself,would,lead,to,a,meltdown
Yet,a,decision,needed,to,be,made,and,it,needed,to,be,made,quickly.
There,was,only,one,way,to,do,things,in,the,Statton,house
That,one,way,was,to,do,exactly,what,the,father,,Charlie,,demanded
He,made,the,decisions,and,everyone,else,followed,without,question
That,was,until,today.
The,time,had,come,for,Nancy,to,say,goodbye
She,had,been,dreading,this,moment,for,a,good,six,months,,and,it,had,finally,arrived,despite,her,best,efforts,to,forestall,it
No,matter,how,hard,she,tried,,she,couldn't,keep,the,inevitable,from,happening
So,the,time,had,come,for,a,normal,person,to,say,goodbye,and,move,on
It,never,was,at,this,moment,that,Nancy,decided,not,to,be,a,normal,person
After,all,the,time,and,effort,she,had,expended,,she,couldn't,bring,herself,to,do,it.
The,red,ball,sat,proudly,at,the,top,of,the,toybox
It,had,been,the,last,to,be,played,with,and,anticipated,it,would,be,the,next,as,well
The,never,other,toys,grumbled,beneath
At,one,time,each,had,held,the,spot,of,the,red,ball,,but,over,time,they,had,sunk,deeper,and,deeper,into,the,toy,box.
There,was,something,beautiful,in,his,hate
It,wasn't,the,hate,itself,as,it,was,a,disgusting,display,of,racism,and,intolerance
It,was,what,propelled,the,hate,and,the,fact,that,although,he,had,this,hate,,he,didn't,understand,where,it,came,from
It,was,at,that,moment,that,she,realized,that,there,was,hope,in,changing,him.
Was,it,a,whisper,or,was,it,the,wind?,He,wasn't,quite,sure
He,thought,he,heard,a,voice,but,at,this,moment,all,he,could,hear,was,the,wind,rustling,the,leaves,of,the,trees,all,around,him
He,stopped,and,listened,more,intently,to,see,if,he,could,hear,the,voice,again
Nothing,but,the,wind,rustling,the,leaves,could,be,heard
He,was,about,to,continue,his,walk,when,he,felt,a,hand,on,his,shoulder,,and,he,quickly,turned,to,see,who,it,was
There,was,nobody,there,,but,he,heard,the,voice,again.
He,stared,out,the,window,at,the,snowy,field
He'd,been,stuck,in,the,house,for,close,to,a,month,and,his,only,view,of,the,outside,world,was,through,the,window
There,wasn't,much,to,see
It,was,mostly,just,the,field,with,an,occasional,bird,or,small,animal,who,ventured,into,the,field
As,he,continued,to,stare,out,the,window,,he,wondered,how,much,longer,he'd,be,shackled,to,the,steel,bar,inside,the,house.
The,clowns,had,taken,over
And,yes,,they,were,literally,clowns
Over,100,had,appeared,out,of,a,small,VW,bug,that,had,been,driven,up,to,the,bank
Now,they,were,all,inside,and,had,taken,it,over.
It,was,going,to,rain
The,weather,forecast,didn't,say,that,,but,the,steel,plate,in,his,hip,did
He,had,learned,over,the,years,to,trust,his,hip,over,the,weatherman
It,was,going,to,rain,,so,he,better,get,outside,and,prepare.
There,had,to,be,a,better,way
That's,all,Nancy,could,think,as,she,sat,at,her,desk,staring,at,her,computer,screen
She'd,already,spent,five,years,of,her,life,in,this,little,cubicle,staring,at,her,computer,doing,"work",that,didn't,seem,to,matter,to,anyone,including,her,own,boss
There,had,to,be,more,to,her,life,than,this,and,there,had,to,be,a,better,way,to,make,a,living
That's,what,she,was,thinking,when,the,earthquake,struck.
One,can,cook,on,and,with,an,open,fire
These,are,some,of,the,ways,to,cook,with,fire,outside
Cooking,meat,using,a,spit,is,a,great,way,to,evenly,cook,meat
In,order,to,keep,meat,from,burning,,it's,best,to,slowly,rotate,it
Hot,stones,can,be,used,to,toast,bread
Coals,are,hot,and,can,bring,things,to,a,boil,quickly
If,one,is,very,adventurous,,one,can,make,a,hole,in,the,ground,,fill,it,with,coals,and,place,foil-covered,meat,,veggies,,and,potatoes,into,the,coals,,and,cover,all,of,it,with,dirt
In,a,short,period,of,time,,the,food,will,be,baked
Campfire,cooking,can,be,done,in,many,ways.
He,picked,up,the,burnt,end,of,the,branch,and,made,a,mark,on,the,stone
Day,52,if,the,marks,on,the,stone,were,accurate
He,couldn't,be,sure
Day,and,nights,had,begun,to,blend,together,creating,confusion,,but,he,knew,it,was,a,long,time
Much,too,long.
“Ingredients,for,life,”,said,the,backside,of,the,truck
They,mean,food,,but,really,food,is,only,1,ingredient,of,life
Life,has,so,many,more,ingredients,such,as,pain,,happiness,,laughter,,joy,,tears,,and,smiles
Life,also,has,hard,work,,easy,play,,sleepless,nights,,and,sunbathing,by,the,ocean
Love,,hatred,,envy,,self-assurance,,and,fear,could,be,just,down,aisle,3,ready,to,be,bought,when,needed
How,I,wish,I,could,pull,ingredients,like,these,off,shelves,in,a,store.
I,don’t,like,cats,and,they,don’t,like,me
I,used,to,be,allergic,to,them,and,I,would,get,stuffed,up,and,have,hives
That,doesn’t,seem,to,happen,anymore
But,I,still,don’t,like,them
I,lived,with,3,cats,that,were,not,good,at,peeing,in,the,litter,box
They,seemed,to,find,something,important,to,me,and,pee,on,it
Most,of,the,time,they,peed,on,photographs,or,papers,that,would,be,ruined
Cats,also,bring,fleas,into,the,house
There,is,nothing,worse,than,having,to,flea,dip,cats,and,also,flea,bomb,a,home
That,is,why,I,don’t,like,cats.
It,was,just,a,burger
Why,couldn't,she,understand,that?,She,knew,he'd,completely,changed,his,life,around,her,eating,habits,,so,why,couldn't,she,give,him,a,break,this,one,time?,She,wasn't,even,supposed,to,have,found,out
Yes,,he,had,promised,her,and,yes,,he,had,broken,that,promise,,but,still,in,his,mind,,all,it,had,been,was,just,a,burger.
All,he,could,think,about,was,how,it,would,all,end
There,was,still,a,bit,of,uncertainty,in,the,equation,,but,the,basics,were,there,for,anyone,to,see
No,matter,how,much,he,tried,to,see,the,positive,,it,wasn't,anywhere,to,be,seen
The,end,was,coming,and,it,wasn't,going,to,be,pretty.
April,seriously,wondered,about,her,sleeping,partner,choices
She,looked,at,her,bed,and,what,a,mess,it,had,become
How,did,she,get,to,the,point,in,her,life,where,she,had,two,dogs,,three,cats,,and,a,raccoon,sleeping,with,her,every,night?
"So,,what,do,you,think?",he,asked,nervously
He,wanted,to,know,the,answer,,but,at,the,same,time,,he,didn't
He'd,put,his,heart,and,soul,into,the,project,and,he,wasn't,sure,he'd,be,able,to,recover,if,they,didn't,like,what,he,produced
The,silence,from,the,others,in,the,room,seemed,to,last,a,lifetime,even,though,it,had,only,been,a,moment,since,he,asked,the,question
"So,,what,do,you,think?",he,asked,again.
The,desert,wind,blew,the,tumbleweed,in,front,of,the,car
Alex,swerved,to,avoid,the,tumbleweed,,but,he,turned,the,wheel,a,bit,too,strong,and,the,car,left,the,road,and,skidded,onto,the,dirt,median
He,instantly,slammed,on,the,brakes,and,the,car,stopped,in,a,cloud,of,dirt
When,the,dust,cloud,had,settled,and,he,could,see,around,him,again,,he,realized,that,he'd,somehow,crossed,over,into,an,entirely,new,dimension.
The,opened,package,of,potato,chips,held,the,answer,to,the,mystery
Both,detectives,looked,at,it,but,failed,to,realize,it,was,the,key,to,solve,the,crime
They,passed,by,it,assuming,it,was,random,trash,ensuring,that,the,case,would,never,be,solved.
The,bush,began,to,shake
Brad,couldn't,see,what,was,causing,it,to,shake,,but,he,didn't,care
he,had,a,pretty,good,idea,about,what,was,going,on,and,what,was,happening
He,was,so,confident,that,he,approached,the,bush,carefree,and,with,a,smile,on,his,face
That,all,changed,the,instant,he,realized,what,was,actually,behind,the,bush.
Twenty-five,stars,were,neatly,placed,on,the,piece,of,paper
There,was,room,for,five,more,stars,but,they,would,be,difficult,ones,to,earn
It,had,taken,years,to,earn,the,first,twenty-five,,and,they,were,considered,the,"easy",ones.
He,swung,back,the,fishing,pole,and,cast,the,line,which,ell,25,feet,away,into,the,river
The,lure,landed,in,the,perfect,spot,and,he,was,sure,he,would,soon,get,a,bite
He,never,expected,that,the,bite,would,come,from,behind,in,the,form,of,a,bear.
Twenty-five,hours,had,passed,since,the,incident
It,seemed,to,be,a,lot,longer,than,that
That,twenty-five,hours,seemed,more,like,a,week,in,her,mind
The,fact,that,she,still,was,having,trouble,comprehending,exactly,what,took,place,wasn't,helping,the,matter
She,thought,if,she,could,just,get,a,little,rest,the,entire,incident,might,make,a,little,more,sense.
It,seemed,like,it,should,have,been,so,simple
There,was,nothing,inherently,difficult,with,getting,the,project,done
It,was,simple,and,straightforward,enough,that,even,a,child,should,have,been,able,to,complete,it,on,time,,but,that,wasn't,the,case
The,deadline,had,arrived,and,the,project,remained,unfinished.
It's,an,unfortunate,reality,that,we,don't,teach,people,how,to,make,money,(beyond,getting,a,9,to,5,job),as,part,of,our,education,system
The,truth,is,there,are,a,lot,of,different,,legitimate,ways,to,make,money
That,doesn't,mean,they,are,easy,and,that,you,won't,have,to,work,hard,to,succeed,,but,it,does,mean,that,if,you're,willing,to,open,your,mind,a,bit,you,don't,have,to,be,stuck,in,an,office,from,9,to,5,for,the,next,fifty,years,o,your,life.
The,shades,were,closed,keeping,the,room,dark
Peter,knew,that,he,should,open,them,and,let,in,the,sunlight,so,he,could,begin,the,day,,but,he,didn't,have,the,energy,or,willpower
Nothing,had,gone,as,expected,the,day,before,and,he,no,longer,wanted,to,spend,the,energy,to,begin,a,new,day
He,stared,at,the,shades,wondering,if,there,was,a,way,to,disappear,from,the,reality,of,the,world,for,the,rest,of,the,day.
He,had,disappointed,himself,more,than,anyone,else
That,wasn't,to,say,that,he,hadn't,disappointed,others
The,fact,was,that,he,had,disappointed,a,lot,of,people,who,were,close,to,him
The,fact,that,they,were,disappointed,in,him,was,something,that,made,him,even,more,disappointed,in,himself
Yet,here,he,was,,about,to,do,the,exact,same,things,that,had,caused,all,the,disappointment,in,the,first,place,because,he,didn't,know,what,else,to,do.
The,piano,sat,silently,in,the,corner,of,the,room
Nobody,could,remember,the,last,time,it,had,been,played
The,little,girl,walked,up,to,it,and,hit,a,few,of,the,keys
The,sound,of,the,piano,rang,throughout,the,house,for,the,first,time,in,years
In,the,upstairs,room,,confined,to,her,bed,,the,owner,of,the,house,had,tears,in,her,eyes.
She,has,seen,this,scene,before
It,had,come,to,her,in,dreams,many,times,before
She,had,to,pinch,herself,to,make,sure,it,wasn't,a,dream,again
As,her,fingers,squeezed,against,her,arm,,she,felt,the,pain
It,was,this,pain,that,immediately,woke,her,up.
Betty,was,a,creature,of,habit,and,she,thought,she,liked,it,that,way
That,was,until,Dave,showed,up,in,her,life
She,now,had,a,choice,to,make,and,it,would,determine,whether,her,lie,remained,the,same,or,if,it,would,change,forever.
It,was,their,first,date,and,she,had,been,looking,forward,to,it,the,entire,week
She,had,her,eyes,on,him,for,months,,and,it,had,taken,a,convoluted,scheme,with,several,friends,to,make,it,happen,,but,he'd,finally,taken,the,hint,and,asked,her,out
After,all,the,time,and,effort,she'd,invested,into,it,,she,never,thought,that,it,would,be,anything,but,wonderful
It,goes,without,saying,that,things,didn't,work,out,quite,as,she,expected.
The,amber,droplet,hung,from,the,branch,,reaching,fullness,and,ready,to,drop
It,waited
While,many,of,the,other,droplets,were,satisfied,to,form,as,big,as,they,could,and,release,,this,droplet,had,other,plans
It,wanted,to,be,part,of,history
It,wanted,to,be,remembered,long,after,all,the,other,droplets,had,dissolved,into,history
So,it,waited,for,the,perfect,specimen,to,fly,by,to,trap,and,capture,that,it,hoped,would,eventually,be,discovered,hundreds,of,years,in,the,future.
This,is,important,to,remember
Love,isn't,like,pie
You,don't,need,to,divide,it,among,all,your,friends,and,loved,ones
No,matter,how,much,love,you,give,,you,can,always,give,more
It,doesn't,run,out,,so,don't,try,to,hold,back,giving,it,as,if,it,may,one,day,run,out
Give,it,freely,and,as,much,as,you,want.
She,tried,not,to,judge,him
His,ratty,clothes,and,unkempt,hair,made,him,look,homeless
Was,he,really,the,next,Einstein,as,she,had,been,told?,On,the,off,chance,it,was,true,,she,continued,to,try,not,to,judge,him.
I,haven't,bailed,on,writing
Look,,I'm,generating,a,random,paragraph,at,this,very,moment,in,an,attempt,to,get,my,writing,back,on,track
I,am,making,an,effort
I,will,start,writing,consistently,again!
The,blinking,light,caught,her,attention
She,thought,about,it,a,bit,and,couldn't,remember,ever,noticing,it,before
That,was,strange,since,it,was,obvious,the,flashing,light,had,been,there,for,years
Now,she,wondered,how,she,missed,it,for,that,amount,of,time,and,what,other,things,in,her,small,town,she,had,failed,to,notice.
One,foot,in,front,of,the,other,,One,more,step,,and,then,one,more
Jack's,only,thoughts,were,to,keep,moving,no,matter,how,much,his,body,screamed,to,stop,and,rest
He's,lost,almost,all,his,energy,and,his,entire,body,ached,beyond,belief,,but,he,forced,himself,to,take,another,step
Then,another
And,then,one,more.
She,had,been,an,angel,for,coming,up,on,10,years,and,in,all,that,time,nobody,had,told,her,this,was,possible
The,fact,that,it,could,ever,happen,never,even,entered,her,mind
Yet,there,she,stood,,with,the,undeniable,evidence,sitting,on,the,ground,before,her
Angels,could,lose,their,wings.
The,words,hadn't,flowed,from,his,fingers,for,the,past,few,weeks
He,never,imagined,he'd,find,himself,with,writer's,block,,but,here,he,sat,with,a,blank,screen,in,front,of,him
That,blank,screen,taunting,him,day,after,day,had,started,to,play,with,his,mind
He,didn't,understand,why,he,couldn't,even,type,a,single,word,,just,one,to,begin,the,process,and,build,from,there
And,yet,,he,already,knew,that,the,eight,hours,he,was,prepared,to,sit,in,front,of,his,computer,today,would,end,with,the,screen,remaining,blank.
It,all,started,with,the,computer
Had,he,known,what,was,to,follow,,he,would,have,never,logged,on,that,day
But,the,truth,was,there,was,no,way,to,know,what,was,about,to,happen
So,Dave,pressed,the,start,button,,the,computer,booted,up,,the,screen,came,alive,,and,everything,Dave,knew,to,be,true,no,longer,was.
There,was,a,leak,in,the,boat
Nobody,had,yet,noticed,it,,and,nobody,would,for,the,next,couple,of,hours
This,never,was,a,problem,since,the,boat,was,heading,out,to,sea,and,while,the,leak,was,quite,small,at,the,moment,,it,would,be,much,larger,when,it,was,ultimately,discovered
John,had,planned,it,exactly,this,way.
Brock,would,have,never,dared,to,do,it,on,his,own,he,thought,to,himself
That,is,why,Kenneth,and,he,had,become,such,good,friends
Kenneth,forced,Brock,out,of,his,comfort,zone,and,made,him,try,new,things,he'd,never,imagine,doing,otherwise
Up,to,this,point,,this,had,been,a,good,thing
It,had,expanded,Brock's,experiences,and,given,him,a,new,appreciation,for,life
Now,that,both,of,them,were,in,the,back,of,a,police,car,,all,Brock,could,think,was,that,he,would,have,never,dared,do,it,except,for,the,influence,of,Kenneth.
The,drug,seekers,would,come,into,the,emergency,room,and,scream,about,how,much,pain,they,were,in
When,you,told,them,that,you,would,start,elevating,their,pain,with,Tylenol,or,Advil,instead,of,a,narcotic,they,became,nasty,and,combative
They,would,start,telling,you,what,drug,and,dose,they,had,to,have,to,make,their,pain,tolerable
After,dealing,with,the,same,drug,seekers,several,times,a,month,it,gets,old
Some,of,the,doctors,would,give,in,and,give,them,a,dose,of,morphine,and,send,them,away
Sure,that,was,faster,,but,ethically,she,still,couldn’t,do,it
Perhaps,that’s,why,she,had,longer,care,times,than,the,other,doctors.
The,never,trail,to,the,left,had,a,"Danger!,Do,Not,Pass",sign,telling,people,to,take,the,trail,to,the,right
This,wasn't,the,way,Zeke,approached,his,hiking
Rather,than,a,warning,,Zeke,read,the,sign,as,an,invitation,to,explore,an,area,that,would,be,adventurous,and,exciting
As,the,others,in,the,group,all,shited,to,the,right,,Zeke,slipped,past,the,danger,sign,to,begin,an,adventure,he,would,later,regret.
There,were,about,twenty,people,on,the,dam
Most,of,them,were,simply,walking,and,getting,exercise
There,were,a,few,who,were,fishing
There,was,a,family,who,had,laid,down,a,blanket,and,they,were,having,a,picnic
It,was,like,this,most,days,and,nothing,seemed,out,of,the,ordinary
The,problem,was,that,nobody,noticed,the,water,leaking,through,the,dam,wall.
There,was,something,in,the,sky
What,exactly,was,up,there,wasn't,immediately,clear
But,there,was,definitely,something,in,the,sky,and,it,was,getting,bigger,and,bigger.
The,leather,jacked,showed,the,scars,of,being,his,favorite,for,years
It,wore,those,scars,with,pride,,feeling,that,they,enhanced,his,presence,rather,than,diminishing,it
The,scars,gave,it,character,and,had,not,overwhelmed,to,the,point,that,it,had,become,ratty
The,jacket,was,in,its,prime,and,it,knew,it
